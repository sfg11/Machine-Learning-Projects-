### The main goal of this project is to train ML models to perform classification on tweets using Twitter APIs. ###
- Naïve Bayes and SVM algorithms are used to train the tweets harvested from Twitter (testing data will be classified on the basis of word-associated sentiment). A sentiment analysis hierarchical classifier predict the  positive/negative sentiment of a word.

- nalysis of the accuracy of classification will conclude with the deployment of the best performing classifier to the sentiment prediction.
