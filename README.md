# Machine Learning Projects 
## Projects from my Intro to Machine Learning CS 4378 
**Project 1:**  

- part 1: implement k-means on 2‐dimensional numerical data by C++ (see pdf in folder for full description)
- part 2: implement hierarchical agglomerative clustering algorithm on 2‐dimensional numerical data by C++

**Project 2:** 

- Implement the Linear Regression algoriithm using batch gradient descent, run algorithm on the training samples / test samples from "linear_regression_data.txt." and get the learned linear function and the predicted results of the testing samples. (normalization to process the inputs with alpha = 0.006.)

**Project 3:**
